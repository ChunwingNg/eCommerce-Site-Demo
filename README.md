Kyle Aban- I essentially helped to create the galaxy background for the website and helped design and implement
many of the frontend portions of the website while helping with general debugging of anything that went wrong along the process.




How to run program:
    Run the SQL code provided inside the databse folder then make sure to have XAMP servers running like normal. Then the website should work as intended.
